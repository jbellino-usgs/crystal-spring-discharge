Introduction
-----------------------------------------------

 This repository serves up a simple demonstration of how springflow is
 computed for Crystal Springs near Zephyrhills, Fla. A Jupyter Notebook
 is used to illustrate the computation process and visualize the resulting
 output.

 It is recommended that the Anaconda python distribution is installed
 prior to running the notebook (https://www.continuum.io/downloads).
 Mimimum requirements for this example are the pandas and numpy packages
 which are part of the default Anaconda environment, but may also be installed
 separately using the program "conda".
 
 Open the notebook "<a href="https://github.com/jbellino-usgs/crystal-spring-discharge/blob/master/Crystal%20Spring%20Discharge.ipynb">Crystal Spring Discharge.ipynb</a>" to get started.
